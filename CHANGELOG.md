## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Social Media Meta (Open Graph)**: each link can carry custom Open Graph / Twitter Card tags (title, description, image, type, card). When a social crawler (Facebook, X, LinkedIn, Slack, Discord, WhatsApp, …) scrapes the short URL, the worker serves a preview page built from those tags; human visitors are redirected normally (301). Configured per link in the dashboard.
- **"Fetch from destination URL"**: a dashboard button that scrapes the destination's existing OG/Twitter tags and pre-fills the fields (only blank fields, so manual edits win). SSRF-guarded (blocks private/loopback/link-local/cloud-metadata hosts), 8s timeout, HTML-only, bounded read.
- DB migration `0021_add_og_meta.sql` — adds the `link_og_meta` table (one row per link, `UNIQUE(link_id)`, `ON DELETE CASCADE`).

## [0.9.2] - 2026-06-22

### Security
- Pinned `vitest` to **4.1.8** (was `^1.6.0`) to resolve critical advisory **GHSA-5xrq-8626-4rwp** / CVE-2026-47429 (Vitest UI server arbitrary file read / code execution). Development-only dependency — it is **not** bundled into the deployed Worker, so there is no production or runtime impact.

---

## [0.9.1] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- **Force password change on first login (#11)**: admins can mark a user "must change password" when creating or editing them. Such users are blocked from the dashboard and API (except change-password / identity / logout) until they set a new password; a forced change screen is shown on login. Enforced server-side on both session middlewares.
- **Configurable route landing page (#12)**: a new **Settings → Default Page** lets an admin choose what a domain's route base serves when no short link is given — a built-in branded page (default), custom HTML, or a redirect to a URL. Replaces the previous "Slug required" message.
- **CSV import column auto-mapping (#14)**: the import UI now auto-selects the matching field for common headers (Destination URL, Slug, Title, Description, Redirect Code, Category, Tags, Route). A "Category" or "Tags" column of **names** is resolved to IDs (existing reused, missing created), a mapped "Redirect Code" column is honored (301/302/307/308), and so CSVs exported by the dashboard round-trip.
- DB migration `0020_add_must_change_password.sql` — adds `users.must_change_password` (`NOT NULL DEFAULT 0`).

### Changed
- Dashboard styling migrated from hardcoded inline colors to theme CSS variables, giving consistent, readable **dark mode** across modals, callouts, panels, and help text. Light mode is visually unchanged.
- Category selection dropdowns and filters now load all categories instead of only the first 25.

### Fixed
- **#18**: only 25 of N categories were selectable in link create/edit and in filters; all categories now appear.
- **#19**: dark-mode readability — callout/info boxes and help text rendered light-on-light (notably the Add Domain modal) and were unreadable.
- CSV import returned HTTP 500 for client errors (missing/unknown domain) instead of the intended 400/404.
- CSV import rows are now atomic — if a row fails after the link is created, the link (and its tags/redirects) is rolled back instead of leaving an orphan.
- Several inline dashboard regexes were silently broken by template-literal escaping (`\s`, `\.` lost), affecting domain-name and IP validation, JSON response highlighting, CSV geo country-name detection, and CSV header auto-mapping.

### Security
- `password_hash`, `mfa_secret`, and `mfa_backup_codes` are no longer included in `/users` API responses (GET/POST/PUT) — they previously leaked to admin/owner callers (and thus browser devtools/logs). `mfa_secret` exposure in particular allowed reconstructing another user's TOTP.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added
- City-based redirect rules: per-link rules that route visitors to a different destination based on their city, matched case-insensitively (`city_name` auto-lowercased on save, max 20 rules per link)
- OS-based redirect rules: per-link rules for `android` and `ios` visitors (max 20 rules per link)
- New redirect priority order: **City → Country → OS → Device → Default URL**
- `GET /api/v1/debug/my-location` endpoint — returns the visitor's detected city, country, region, and timezone; useful for verifying exact values before setting up redirect rules
- `Vary: CF-IPCity` added to response headers when city redirects are present, preventing cross-city cache poisoning
- Dashboard UI forms for managing city and OS redirect rules, including inline help text
- DB migration `0018_add_city_os_redirects.sql` — new `link_city_redirects` and `link_os_redirects` tables with `ON DELETE CASCADE`
- Batch fetch support for city/OS redirects (`getLinksCityRedirectsBatch`, `getLinksOsRedirectsBatch`)
- CSV import support for `city_redirects` and `os_redirects` columns
- Bulk update support for city and OS redirect rules
- Links created via the API or CSV import now default their `route` to the domain's primary route (`routes[0]` / `routing_path`) when none is provided, matching dashboard behavior so links are always reachable under the domain's configured path (`getEffectiveLinkRoute` in new `src/utils/route.ts`)
- DB migration `0019_backfill_link_routes.sql` — backfills the route on pre-existing links that were created without one

### Changed
- Geo data source switched from `cf-ipcountry`/`cf-ipcity` headers to `request.cf.country`/`request.cf.city` (populated by Cloudflare by default), with header fallback for environments using the Visitor Location Headers Managed Transform
- OS detection in `parseUserAgent` now checks `android` and `ios` before `mac`/`linux`, fixing misclassification of Android (which contains "linux") and iOS (which contains "mac") user agents
- Analytics click tracking (`trackClickAsync`) uses the same `request.cf` source for city/country, keeping geo data consistent with redirect resolution
- Redirect cache (re)build now always fetches all redirect rules from the database instead of reusing a stale cache entry — an older entry could predate the city/OS feature and silently drop those rules
- Links list query now returns the domain's `routing_path` so the dashboard can render the correct short URL for routeless links
- `resolveDestinationUrl`, `extractGeoFromRequest`, and `buildVaryHeader` exported from `redirect.ts` for testability

### Fixed
- 7 issues identified in city/OS redirect code review: type safety, stale-cache patch path, Vary header, OS detection order, analytics geo source, schema defaults, and batch fetch wiring
- Dashboard "Short URL" column showed a bare slug (e.g. `domain.com/slug`) for links without a stored route on a prefixed domain (e.g. `/go/*`); now falls back to the domain's `routing_path` and displays the working URL (`domain.com/go/slug`)
- `deleteCityRedirect` now lowercases `city_name` before matching, consistent with how city names are stored
